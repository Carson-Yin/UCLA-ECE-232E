The code for project 4 is divided into 2 parts. One part is written in R to solve Question 1~5 asked in the hand-out. 
The other part is written in Python for Question 11-15 and the self-defined task. 
Since the close relationship between our own task and Question 10, the code for our own task is included in Question 10. 
And the image shown as Figure 11 in our report is drawn through Tableau, which is not contained in our code.
